# You can define mounts as variables. All parameters for the `mount` module are
# supported. On top of that, `mode`, `owner` and `group` can be defined.

# mount_requests:
#   - path: /mnt/tmp
#     src: /tmp
#     opts: bind
#     state: mounted
#     fstype: none
#     owner: root
#     group: root
